#At first this was in the models.py file but then I realized I should just pseudo the whole thing and then start putting pieces where they need to be

#dndCharCom is meant to recreate tabletop RPG combat including random dice rolls by click.

#using a character creator that was partially written out before with the class I will store characters in the the DB

#character models will include the list below but the initial implementation of the combat similator will be very simple

#get two fighter character models completed, all stats coded, all manuevers and special actions written out as rules that direct the characters available choices

#at first the only choice will be "attack" since special manuevers are restricted to higher level characters

#however any character can technically try to wrestle another one, so those rules should be second at least

#the attacks will follow the same equations as in DnD, which I need to write out

#the attacks will remove health from the character model, check if they died or a special status was applied, and then pass the turn

#who takes first turn will greatly impact how fights go, so it will be a random coin flip or the user can give one fighter first turn

#each turn the first character takes an action, a bonus action, and may move once I make the grid for them to move on

#then the second character, if still alive, takes an action, a bonus action, and may move if possible

#then just keep going until a character dies or the player exits the game

# Timeline for project

# End of week one complete character entry / character model
# End of week two complete combat app for single fighter combat
# End of week three have functional combat display, full user login, storage
# and review of characters

# scope for project
# combat app
#     retrieve character models
#     by turn sequence allow models to attack one another
#     apply damage until one "dies"
#     congratulate winner #AND give a summary of the battle? 
#     store win / loss record
# character creation 
#     allow full character creation
#     store character
#     allow user to login and see their characters
#     #allow user to edit characters? (stretch)

# mad lib combat description flavor adder?

# out of scope for combat app
# #saving games
# #saving character models post combat status
# #all combat will use the character model as entered into the DB, and will not allow alterations

# #potential scope for character app
# #modifying character models after creation

# so it will be two apps working together to first build the character model, and then store it in the DB

# then retrieve the model from the DB and apply changes to it on screen for the user

# I would like to have some "flavor" for combat descriptions similar to dwarf fortress "you hit him with the axe" vs "you deliver a glancing blow, but still manage to cut open their forearm".
# #severity of bow can be based on total percentage of possible damage done. so a d12 die rolling a 4 would be a glancing blow, but a 12 would be a "solid hit, the other character looks shaken"
# #just put a bunch of phrases into a dictionary and based on percentage of damage of die grab the index value. so roll a d6 or d8, divide the roll by highest possible value, add descriptor for flavor
# # 10: 'barely connected', 
# # 20: 'the blow lands but didn't have much force'
# # 30: 'you strike but not true, doing less damage than you had hoped. they are still bleeding though"
# # 40: 'hey, there's some new red on them'
# # 50: 'that hurt'
# # 60: 'you hear things crack as the blow lands solidly'
# # 70: 'by GAWD the man had a family'
# # 80: 'if there was a crowd they would have gasped at the sound that made
# # 90: 'you hit them as hard as you could, and they know it'
# # 100: 'SHOOKETH'

# #just goofin around with the above, not sure a dictionary / index is the right way to do this. 

# Hey, here is a thought, could I bring in the madlib app????
# # don't recreate the wheel, just run the attack description through the mad-lib app to spice it up

# #meaning I would also need to tie in the madlib app, write the flavor wording however is easiest, and make it a 3 app party

# Character model will have normal range of stats, class, and all relevant data from a standard character sheet
#     #charModel:
#     #hp: integer #represent hit points
#     #name: string 
#     #class: (fighter, wizard, cleric, druid, barbarian, bard, rogue, sorcerer, paladin) #gotta build each of these classes with any special rules like paladins getting smite, sorcerer spellslot limits, fighter combat shenanigans
#     #available_actions: integer (most characters have one action and one bonus action per turn plus a free action)
#     #wpn_dmg_dice: d2,d3,d4,d6,d8,d10,d12
#     #wpn_modifiers: integer that interacts with wpn_dmg_dice
#     #char_modifiers: blinded in one eye?
#     #spell_slots: 1st:0,2nd:0,3rd:0,4th:0,5th:0,6th:0,7th:0,8th:0,9th:0 
#     # spell slots are used to cast spells, no slots, no spells
#     #special_actions: integer (some classes like fighter allow the use of additional dice, would use that here)
#     #race: from char creation
#     #height: for flavor?
#     #size: (small, medium, large, giant, behemoth?) important for combat rules
#     #mvmt_speed: (advanced goal is to figure out combat arena and movement)
#     #armor_type: light, medium, heavy
#     #armor_penalty: non_casting for casters in heavy plate for example
#     #str_stat: int
#     #con_stat: int
#     #int_stat: int
#     #wis_stat: int
#     #char_stat: int
#     #dex_stat: int
#     #armor_Class: int
#     #status: like prone, sickened, entangled, constricted, swallowed, poisoned etc this will be important for spell / fighting due to prone condition and fighter combat manuevers

#     #stats will be set at character creation and stored in the character model

#     #for combat the two character models will "attack" each other by rolling a d20
    
#     #12 on the Die 

#     #combat equation
#     #attack_roll = d20_roll + str/dex mod + (offhand modifier if relevant)
#     #damage will be applied to the models on a hit 
#     #if attack_roll is higher than armor_Class then apply attack damage:

#     #attack = str/dex mod + wpn_dmg_dice(modifiers go here)
    
#     #charModel_fighter loses attack amount of hp

#     NEED TO FLESH OUT:

#     #action rules: since some characters can forego actions, take secondary actions, can have additional actions granted to them
    
#     #armor_class rules: can simply ignore and only go on AC set dsuring character creation, but there are goofy rules that alter combat based on type of armore being worn
    
#     #spellcasting rules: depending on what type of spellcaster the character is they get a different number of spell slots and can use them separately. 
#     #those should go in the spellcaster classes as much as possible but some rules apply to all spellcaster generally
    
#     spellcasting_equation = d20_roll + caster_class_mod + modifiers (spellcasting equation only used for "roll to hit spells")

#     #class_models:

#     paladin {
#         #spellslots like cleric, similar spell selection list
#         #need domains
#         #smite equation should go here, only allow smiting from within the class #(remember they get to pick whether to smite after the die is rolled but not before the hit is known .... right? double check)
#         #requires spell focus
#     }

#     cleric {
#         #unique class feature all spells immediately available, just gotta pick them each combat #in game its one prayer session per day I think
#         #requires spell focus
#     }    

#     fighter {
#         #fighter pretty much just whack stuff until they get combat manuevers and secondary actions
#         #secondary action rules go here
#         #combat manuevers
#         #dual wielding?
#         #offhand rules?
#     }

#     barbarian {
#         rage rules
#         reckless attack rules need to go here, using it gives opportunity on all attacks against you for the round
#         #dual handing rules? is that a class specific thing?
#         #dex vs str thing dont forget #barbarians can pick str or dex as their weapon stat, so there are dex barbarian builds. I think this is not a unique class feature. pretty sure fighters have this to.
#     }

#     wizard{
#         #spell stuff is a stretch goal, there are so many effects spells can have, and a lot depend on area being a thing
#         #meaning I need a battlegroung and spacing to really show spells correctly
#         #thankfully most of the combat casters just use their spell slots as extra damage on hits
#     }

#     sorcerer {
#         #gotta be honest, I know like nothing about sorcs
#         #gotta learn the rules
#     }

#     rogue{
#         #sneak attack rules
#         #hidden status can be a modifier
#         #technically a hidden character has a 50/50 shot of being hit even on a successful attack roll, so that will complicate things
#         #an observed character can't hide, and this is single combat at least to start
#         #hiding rules are a stretch goal! lol
