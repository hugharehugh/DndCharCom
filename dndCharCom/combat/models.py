    #charModel:
#     hp: integer (represent hit points)

#     available_actions: integer (most characters have one action and one bonus action per turn plus a free action)
#     wpn_dmg_dice: d2,d3,d4,d6,d8,d10,d12
#     modifiers: integer that interacts with wpn_dmg_dice

#     # spell slots are used to cast spells, no slots, no spells
#     special_actions: integer (some classes like fighter allow the use of additional dice, would use that here)
#     race: from char creation
#     # height: for flavor?
#     size: (small, medium, large, giant, behemoth?) important for combat rules
#     mvmt_speed: (advanced goal is to figure out combat arena and movement)
#     armor_type: light, medium, heavy
#     armor_penalty: non_casting for casters in heavy plate for example
#     str_stat: int
#     # con_stat: int
#     int_stat: int
#     wis_stat: int
#     char_stat: int
#     dex_stat: int
#     armor_Class: int
#     status: this will be important for spell / fighting due to prone condition and fighter combat manuevers

#     #stats will be set at character creation and stored in the character model

#     #for combat the two character models will "attack" each other by rolling a d20
    
#     #12 on the Die 

#     #combat equation
#     attack_roll = d20_roll + str/dex mod + (offhand modifier if relevant)
#     #damage will be applied to the models on a hit 
#     if attack_roll is higher than armor_Class then apply attack damage:

#     attack = str/dex mod + wpn_dmg_dice(modifiers go here)
    
#     charModel_fighter loses attack amount of hp

#     NEED TO FLESH OUT:

#     action rules: since some characters can forego actions, take secondary actions, can have additional actions granted to them
    
#     armor_class rules: can simply ignore and only go on AC set dsuring character creation, but there are goofy rules that alter combat
    
#     spellcasting rules: depending on what type of spellcaster the character is they get a different number of spell slots and can use them separately. 
#     those should go in the spellcaster classes as much as possible but some rules apply to all spellcaster generally
#     spellcasting_equation = d20_roll + caster_class_mod + modifiers (spellcasting equation only used for "roll to hit spells")

#  spellcasting_equation = d20_roll + caster_class_mod + modifiers (spellcasting equation only used for "roll to hit spells")

#         #dex vs str thing dont forget #barbarians can pick str or dex as their weapon stat, so there are dex barbarian builds. I think this is not a unique class feature. pretty sure fighters have this to.
