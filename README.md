Dnd Character Combat Sim

Character sheets wil be stored in the users app

The User will be prompted on signing up for the first time to make a character using the character creator,

OR they can pick a premade character and jump into combat

The "computer" will pick a random character from the available file and the two characters will

Each take a turn in combat once per round unless prevented from doing so by a status

Based on the character selected, combat options will be available.

Initially all combatants will be fighters, will not use spells, and manuevers are a hopeful inclusion.

The weapons the fighter uses will be based on the character model / character creation.

Combat will be the app that contains all rules for character combat in DnD. 

The characters will basically be fed into the app until someone loses.

Flavornator will enhance the descriptions of combat, and I would like to enable / disable it via a button or click.
